# SWITCH-CASE
In TypeScript, the switch statement is used to execute one block of code from multiple possibilities. Here's the basic structure of a switch statement:

 expression is usually a variable or value that you want to compare.
 case value: represents the value that you want to compare expression against.

 break; is used to exit the switch statement once a case is matched. Without it, the switch statement will continue executing the next case even if the current one matches.

 default: is optional and provides a default case if none of the cases match the expression
